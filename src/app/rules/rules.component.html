        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. </li>
        <li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. ...</li>
        <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
        <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.</li>

        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. 
        Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.
        <br><br>
        Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. 
        The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.
        <br><br>
        After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? 
        You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.
        <br><br>
        You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. 
        If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. 
        You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
        <br><br>
        If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. 
        You may not win, but at least you'll tie.
